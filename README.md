## Protistan microbial communities: the forgotten validation in metatranscriptome assessment

Protistan communities are diverse. They are also not generally the focus of assessment and validation procedures for 'omics techniques. Bacteria lead the way as part of the "pack" of microbes that need to be assembled, identified, and otherwise validated. This is because of the relative simplicity (speaking loosely) of bacterial genomes and transcriptomes, but also because of the existing research that already supports prokaryotic genetic assessment. This is particularly poignant due to the role of bacteria in human disease and health, which makes them a priority for study. 

However, metatranscriptomes (among other tools) are increasingly being applied to eukaryote-dominated environmental communities. Though validation has been performed using other genetic tools, e.g. PCR approaches, or through microscopic counts, there is an urgent need for general validation of omics tools for assembling and annotating eukaryote-dominated metatranscriptomes. 

For this reason, we have developed this companion tool to the `eukrhythmic` microbial eukaryote metatranscriptome analysis pipeline!
